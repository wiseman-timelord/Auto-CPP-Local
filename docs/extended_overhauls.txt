To continue the work on correcting, optimizing, improving, streamlining too many scripts to handle in 1 input...

INFORMATION: 
We are re-creating "AutoGPT 1.3" as a fork named "AutoCPP=Lite, while the current version of "AutoGPT is "AutoGPT 5.1", we are using "v1.3" for a smaller initial codebase. We are programming towards, "Windows 10" and "non-wsl python 3.9". We are in a mid-to-late session in the initial project of conversion and modification, and remember we have limited interactions before I have to wait for a chat refresh, so ensure updates are clear and comprehensive. 

Here is the file-structure, note ".\main.py" is mostly self-contained pre-launch/import configuration menu, that, saves settings to the yaml and imports  imports ".\scripts\main.py" into itself, which then imports the other scripts in .\scripts into itself as required...

.\Installer.bat
.\Launcher.bat
.\main.py
.\data
.\data\persistent_settings.backup
.\data\persistent_settings.yaml

INSTRUCTION:
- due to less scripts and many modifications, checking logic and sanity, in script, while ensuring updates to produce, completeness and correctness, in scripts. No doubt there are some incomplete and/or inefficient processes, mainly from merging about 35 files into about 10 in a rushed process, and also we added/upgraded/replaced/cut certain features after.  check for, correctness and completenes, of current implementations, fix any logical errors.
- many functions that were in separate scripts, are now in the same script, so there will be some streamlining to be had also.
Remember, do NOT print any significant amounts of code in your response, wait for the other scripts, for reference, and other more important options for improvement, that may arise..

RESOURCE:
below are the scripts we are checking over, I can only give you so many scripts, then in the following response I shal give you more, produce updates as you feel confident to, given the files provided from the list, request specifically to see files if you need to check anything.

```
***Script***
```

```
***Script***
```

Resources:
As I said, I am providing more scripts, perform similar analysis, but also reference to confirm operation of parts you have already highlighted.
