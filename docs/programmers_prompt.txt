INFORMATION: 
We are re-creating "AutoGPT 1.3", it is a simpler version, than the current "AutoGPT 5.1", it is now as a fork of the original. We are programming towards, "Windows 10" and "non-wsl python 3.9". We are in the second session of editing, and we have limited interactions before I have to wait for a chat refresh, so ensure updates are clear and comprehensive.
