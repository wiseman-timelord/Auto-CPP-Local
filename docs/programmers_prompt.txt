INFORMATION: 
We are re-creating "AutoGPT 1.3" as a fork named "AutoCPP=Lite`, while the current version of "AutoGPT` is "AutoGPT 5.1", we are using "v1.3" for a smaller initial codebase. We are programming towards, "Windows 10" and "non-wsl python 3.9". We are in a mid-to-late session in the initial project of conversion and modification, and remember we have limited interactions before I have to wait for a chat refresh, so ensure updates are clear and comprehensive. 

Here is the file-structure, note ".\main.py" imports ".\scripts\main.py", hence there is mostly self-contained pre-launch/import configuration menu in ".\main.py"...
```
